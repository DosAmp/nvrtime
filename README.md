nvrtime
=======

nvrtime is a utility for PCem/86Box to set an appropriate year for non-Y2K compatible operating systems. It takes an NVRAM file for a PC/AT compatible board as a parameter. Time synchronization should be disabled in the VM settings.

Currently, an offset of 28 years is used by default to synchronize the days of the week and leap years between the 2020-2027 time period and the 1992-1999 time period.
